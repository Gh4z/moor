-- 1 -- Introduction


    Moor...
        - is a small library for PHP 5
        - lets you define resources with a simple URL => callback mapping
        - can take many shapes and be configured in many ways.
        - would encourage you to keep things RESTful, but it's up to you
    
    Moor is broken up into 2 separate pieces:

    Moor.php
        The URL router. Matches a URL pattern, extracts 
        defined parameters from it, and runs a callback.

    MoorResource.php
        A Rails-esque controller extension for Moor. Not required,
        but worthwhile on larger projects.
    

-- 2 -- Hello World

    Moor::map('/', 'hello');
    Moor::run();

    function hello() {
        echo 'hello world';
    }	
    
    -- OR --
    
    (if you're lucky enough to be on PHP 5.3)
    
    Moor::map('/', function() {
        echo '<h1>hello world</h1>';
    });

	Moor::run();
    

-- 3 -- Param Matching & Extraction

Coming Soon
    
-- 4 -- MoorResource
